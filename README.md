# Address Book

##### Address book with adding and clearing abilities, 8/7/2015

#### By J^3 (Jordan Johan Johansen)

## Description

The homepage of this address book displays all current entries, along with a form for adding new contact information (name, phone number, and address).  Clicking 'Add Contact' takes the user to a page displaying the information for the most recent addition, along with a link to return to the main page.  The 'Clear Contacts' button deletes all current entries and takes user to a page confirming contact deletion, as well as mocking them for the clearly depressing life they lead.  This page also has a link back to the homepage.

## Setup

* Run composer install from the Terminal in the project root folder (folder containing composer.json)
* Start PHP server in web folder (containing index.php)

## Technologies Used

PHP, Silex micro-framework, Twig templates.
